<SPAN CLASS="LARGE">We can broadly classify the possible services along four dimensions: Reliable data transfer, throughput, timing and security.

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Reliable Data Transfer:</SPAN>
		Packets can get lost within a computer network. For example, a packet can overflow a buffer in a router, or can be discarded by a host or router after having some of its bits corrupted. When a transport
		protocol provides this service, the sending process can just pass its data into the socket and know with
		complete confidence that the data will arrive without errors at the receiving process.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Throughput:<A ID="tex2html1"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot108"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A></SPAN>
		transport-layer protocol could provide, namely, guaranteed available throughput at some specified rate. With such a service, the application could request a guaranteed throughput of r bits/sec, and the transport protocol would then ensure that the available throughput is always at least r bits/sec. Such a guaranteed throughput service would appeal to many applications.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Timing:</SPAN>
		As with throughput guarantees, timing
		guarantees can come in many shapes and forms. An example guarantee might be that every bit that the
		sender pumps into the socket arrives at the receiverâ€™s socket no more than 100 msec later. Such a
		service would be appealing to interactive real-time applications, such as Internet telephony, virtual
		environments, teleconferencing, and multiplayer games.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Security:</SPAN>
		Finally, a transport protocol can provide an application with one or more security services. For example,
		in the sending host, a transport protocol can encrypt all data transmitted by the sending process, and in
		the receiving host, the transport-layer protocol can decrypt the data before delivering the data to the
		receiving process. Such a service would provide confidentiality between the two processes, even if the
		data is somehow observed between sending and receiving processes.
